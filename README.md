# ft_irc

You have to develop an IRC server in C++ 98.
You mustn’t develop a client.
You mustn’t handle server-to-server communication.
Your executable will be run as follows:
./ircserv <port> <password>
- port: The port number on which your IRC server will be listening to for incoming
IRC connections.
- password: The connection password. It will be needed by any IRC client that tries
to connect to your server.

Check the subject for requirements.
